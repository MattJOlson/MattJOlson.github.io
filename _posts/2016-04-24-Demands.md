title: Demands 0.1 released
---

I'm writing a small runtime-assertions library for C#. I wouldn't call
it production-ready just yet, but it's probably complete enough to be
useful.

{% highlight PowerShell %}
PM> Install-Package Demands
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight C# %}
Demand.That(snowflake.Specialness < 42)
      .OrThrow<SpecialSnowflakeException>("Snowflake too special");

Demand.ThatFor(someEnumerable)
      .AtLeast(1).Match(x => x % 2 == 0)
      .Because("someEnumerable must be able to even");
{% endhighlight %}

page](https://github.com/MattJOlson/Demands).
