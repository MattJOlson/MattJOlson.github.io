title: Hello, world!
---

Don't we all title first posts that way? (Well, there's always "First
post!", but I never liked that much on slashdot or anywhere since.) At
any rate, I've felt for a long time that I should be writing a
(professional) development blog, and now here we are.

# Who is this guy, anyway?

Well, there's always the [About page](/about).

As of this post, I'm a polyglot developer whose current job is writing
back-end .NET. I marinate in C# at work and study F#, Haskell, and
maybe a bit of Idris on my own time. I expect actor-model architectures
and functional reactive programming to take over the world...
eventually. I also expect to look back on this post in five years and
roll my eyes so hard I sprain something.

# What's going on here?

My writing tends towards the polemic.

I'm probably going to write a lot about development at the coding level,
since that's most of what I do. I like code that's terse, expressive,
robust, and well tested, but fundamentally I like code that does its job
correctly. You'll get posts about testing, readability, and quite
possibly the latest shiny feature, tool, or idiom I've come across.

I'm also interested in methods and cultures, both within and across
organizations. I'm approaching this partly from the perspective of an
enthusiastic new convert to domain-driven design, and partly from trying
to grok the elements of hacking on software with other people that make
it great, or make it suck -- aiming for more of the former and less of
the latter.

There's plenty of overlap.

# What's up with the name?

I don't do much cache-invalidation these days.
