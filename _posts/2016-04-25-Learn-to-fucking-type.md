title: Learn to type

Most devs -- [Uncle Bob famously
excepted](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073)
-- worship the _flow state_. We're in the zone; problems flit past our
awareness until we grapple them with a test case and solutions flow out
of our fingertips fully-formed, as if we turned the test bar green with
our _minds_ rather than with our keyboards and IDEs. We sculpt and
refactor with a serene ease that would make Michelangelo cast down his
chisels and stomp off in disgust were he only alive to see it.

And then we stop, curse a blue streak that makes passing bikers stop to
take notes, and backspace over the last seven characters to turn that
`0` into a `0` -- no FUCK YOU, a `0` -- you little dog's ass it's a `-`.
_Finally!_  Where was I.

For a breed of creature that likes to earn its living at a keyboard in a
state of communion with the text editor behind it, most of us sure suck
at typing. (Perhaps you don't. I applaud you!)

So maybe before checking Facebook at lunch, or watching that cool NDC
talk on your laptop on the train home, you should hit
[Typegun](http://typegun.com/) level OMG for a few minutes of
frustrating self-improvement. (I just did, after neglecting it for a few
months, and scored 31.8wpm at 88.8% accuracy. On plain text I usually
hit 110wpm. It's humbling.)

Also, I made a shit-ton of typos writing this post. Looks like I need
some more practice.
