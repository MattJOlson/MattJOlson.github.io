My name's Matt Olson. I'm a nerd; currently that's pronounced "polyglot
developer".

I have a Ph.D. in computer graphics, where I focused on doing neat
things with silhouette curves on surface models. I don't do that for
work, which I used to think was a shame. It sure taught me to learn well
in a hurry, though.

I've spent about twenty years writing in C-like languages, and about ten
wishing I could use something a lot more functional instead. These days
I'm getting paid to write C# on the back end, working patiently to get
more F# into my professional diet, and thinking more and more about how
tools and culture at the team level and above make work awesome, or make
it suck.

I think continuous testing, vi key bindings, tmux, and Hindley-Milner
type inference are life-changing tools. Given the opportunity, I use
1TBS over Allman in curly-brace languages and characters over tiles in
Nethack.
